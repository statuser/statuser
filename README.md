- 👋 Hi, I’m @statuser, AKA John Howell, a professor of marketing and data analytics at Brigham Young University.
- 👀 I study Bayesian Statistics applied to marketing.  I also dabble in heathcare work related to representing the voice of the patient in health care decisions.  I am especially interested in the idea that all consumers face constraints that limit the choices and purchases they can make.  Many times these constraints are not financial in nature and it leads to them being underappreciated in economic models of consumer choice.
- 🚧 I am thinking and working on a project to develop software to bring personalized analytics to the enterprise.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Web Development, App Development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting research projects and and personalized analytics. 
- 📫 How to reach me on Twitter @statuser or via [my university profile](https://marriott.byu.edu/directory/details?id=62191)
